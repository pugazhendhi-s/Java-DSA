    Cohesion -> it makes sure that the class is designed with single, well-focused
    Difference between high cohesion and low cohesion:
        1. High cohesion is when you have a class that does a well-defined job.
            Low cohesion is when a class does a lot of jobs that donâ€™t have much in common.
        2. High cohesion gives us better-maintaining facility and
            Low cohesion results in monolithic classes that are difficult to maintain, understand and reduce re-usability
